    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Original recipe yields 8 servings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1 rotisserie-roasted chicken</li>
        <li>&#8531; cup and &#189; tablespoon and &#189; teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>&#8531; cup and &#189; tablespoon and &#189; teaspoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>&#189; cup hot sauce (such as Frank's&#174; Redhot&#174;), or more to taste</li>
        <li>&#189; cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted 
            water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the 
            boiling water, stirring occasionally 
            until tender yet firm to the bite, 
            8 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut wings and legs off rotisserie 
            chicken. Skin and bone wings and legs; 
            chop or shred dark meat into bite-size 
            pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over 
            medium heat. Whisk in flour gradually 
            until a thick paste forms. Cook until 
            golden, about 1 minute. Pour in milk, 
            whisking constantly, until thickened and 
            bubbling, about 5 minutes. Continue to 
            cook until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute 
            more. Reduce heat and season sauce with 
            black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese 
            into the sauce until melted and combined. 
            Stir in hot sauce, adjusting to reach 
            desired level of spiciness. Add blue 
            cheese, chicken, and macaroni; mix well 
            to combine.
        </li>
    </ol>
